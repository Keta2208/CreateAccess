## Project Proposal 
Finding convenient and engaging learning opportunities is a challenge for users who are interested in 3-D creation but lack experience or resources. Users want to explore 3D authoring to open up new possibilities for creative and professional development. However, they often encounter the following barriers:

- High cost: Traditional 3D tools and training can be costly, preventing many from participating.
- Lack of support: Beginners are confused by the complexity of 3D creation and struggle to find reliable resources that are easy to get started.
- Lack of opportunity awareness: Many people are unaware of the career paths associated with 3D creation.

CreateAccess is committed to removing these barriers and helping users get started by offering free mini-courses. However, the existing website's user interface is not intuitive enough to quickly engage and guide users, especially first-time visitors. In addition, mobile access and accessibility features have not been fully optimized.
